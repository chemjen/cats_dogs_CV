This is just a repository of me playing around in tensorflow and keras with photos of cats and dogs for computer vision.

Goals:
image preprocessing - rgb/hsv/hsl, image augmentation, segmentation, finding edges...
building neural networks for image classification 
using pretrained networks for clustering
